Matrices are from the UF Sparse Matrix Collection and must be in Matrix Market format.

To download the dataset from the paper, you can download and convert it from source 
using the download_dataset.sh script then processing all the tar files with 
process_inputs.py. 

To add matrices to the test set for some experiment, add them to registry.json as well as the experiment_*.py
file in src/ that you want to run. You will need to regenerate the slurm experiment scripts.
